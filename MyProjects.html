I created this app to promote my airline on my own social media platform based on an airline called aero baez. On this website the text and speech are both presented in english and spanish as this is a south american/ mexican company. Before using this app as required by panamanian law, I am supposed to give a warning of the potential threats/ dangers of using this website and ways to prevent somebody from hacking you or selling your information. If you touch the canvas, it will give you warning. If you also drag the canvas it can also take a picture. After, you can change the pictures to a supported anime character called Shin Chan and a sample of our airline. You can reset all of this and can draw in both red and black. Thank you.</p>
<p>I learned many things while making this app. I learned how to be more organized with block coding and learned how to design it really well. I also found many websites which can help edit my website. Adding on, I got the knowledge of how to bock code myself and not to be scared to always to be correct. This experience was amazing.</p>
<p>
Some problems and bugs I had was the emulator since my computer was always trying to load the emulator, but it never happened  Luckily the tablets came on time and I was able to use it and improve my app at the best of my abilities.

This was the first every coding project that I have ever completed. This is a very special project to me since it introduced me to the fun and beautiful coding world that is out there. Furthermore, this project made me learn the basincs of MIT App Inventor. Before, I used to be pessimistic towards, programming overall, but after getting introduced to MIT App Inventor, it showed me how creative I can be and how joyous coding is overall. This project was the jumpstart to my amazing coding journey!

App Description
</h3>
<p>
This app is designed to create a school emergency plan during an unexpected or a situation where the students/ pupils and the staff are in danger from external threats. This app is encrypted  for everybody inhabiting the school as it requires a DUSD username and password. After filling out all of the important details, then the app will track the person who is using this app. Then the floor plan of Dublin High School will appear and it will try to show all of the possible exits for the student. Furthermore, as the person tries to escape, they will get a notification if they want to report this situation or the usage to the authorities. The app will then immediately call the emergency line (911) and there will be an immediate response (sound effects) quoting that they have tracked their location and that they will immediately arrive at their destination. The app in another screen will show the estimated ETA for the officials to arrive. The starting location will be the Dublin Police Headquarters right by Alameda County library.

This is one of the best projects that I ever had since everybody collaborated really well and person had a different set of expertise to offer. I would say that this was one of the most challenging projects we created since creating multiple pages with MIT App Inventor is time consuming. I learned more skills with MIT App Inventor, throughout this project
